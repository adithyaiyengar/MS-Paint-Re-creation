<h1 class="author"> Microsoft Paint: Web Edition </h1>

Our project is a revamped, re-energized, and reinvigorated version of Microsoft Paint,
so much in fact that some would call it REvolutionary. We feel like the world needs to move away 
from standalone applications and we highly encourage the use of web-based design. 
Great products, including Microsoft SkyDrive, Google Drive, and iCloud have migrated to the use of the cloud, 
a virtual databank. It is clear that the cloud is a step in the right direction. We would like to move applications 
to the web for easy access, both online and off. We are finally happy to announce the birth of SKAD(subject to change),
the world's finest sketchup and text program. </p>

<h1 class="about"> Why Should you Consider Falling in Love? </h1>
<p>
SKAD is brilliant. SKAD is simple. SKAD is elegant. It's easy-to-use interface allows both amateurs and artists alike to create breathtaking portraits.
 As a parent, you'll love seeing what your child can produce. 
 Kids love color, and SKAD loves color, too. </p>
<h1 class="about"> How much does SKAD cost? </h1>
<p> It's free. And it always will be.</p>
