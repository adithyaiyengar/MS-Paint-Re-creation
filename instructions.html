<h1>Instruction Manual</h1>
<h2>By: Adithya Iyengar, Ryan Harradine, Hari Chittilla</h2>
<body> 
<p> To use our web-based edition of MS Paint, simple instructions can be followed. </br>
Note: before proceeding with any of the following instructions, please ensure that both fill type and color are selected. Whenever the color is changed, the submit color button should be clicked. Another helpful tip is that the canvas window is 500px by 500px. When determining dimensions, keep this in mind. Also before any shape is drawn, certain aspects of its dimensions must be set in the table in the toolbox.

<ol> Instructions for Making Gradients
<li>Linear gradients take 4 coordinate values to draw a gradient. The starting and ending x and y coordinates make a line. This line is where the different colors of the gradient transition. The gradient will only occur within the line, so make sure the line is long enough for what you are drawing.</li>
<li>Radial gradients are a little more difficult to understand. The color transitions expand from the starting circle to the ending circle. Here's a picture to better explain this:<br/> <img src="http://tavmjong.free.fr/SVG/RADIALGRAD/radial_gradient_focus_spread2.png" alt="" height="" width""> </li>
<li>To clear gradient and return to a normal fill style, press the No Gradient button under Choose Gradient Fill Style</li>
